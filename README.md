Clinic is a HIPAA-compliant cloud-based patient interaction tool that works with any electronic health record system. Clinic uses a Google API that employs a powerful differential diagnostic engine to classify potential illnesses based on patient symptoms.  Patients may use the Symptom Checker API to enter their symptoms, gender, and age to learn about the diseases they may be suffering from. Clinic offers secure two-way messaging, electronic patient forms, smart appointment scheduling and reminders, mass texting, automated survey and rating requests, online payments, and multi-user telemedicine to deliver a full patient engagement experience. We are able to incorporate seamlessly with virtually every electronic health record system.
